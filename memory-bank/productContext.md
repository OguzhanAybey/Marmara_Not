# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to find reliable and organized lecture notes for their specific courses. Notes are scattered across various platforms (social media groups, drives) or physical copies, making access difficult and inconsistent.

## Solution
Marmara_Not provides a structured, web-based repository for lecture notes. It mirrors the university's academic structure (Faculties > Departments > Courses) to make finding relevant content intuitive.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should easily find their course within 3-4 clicks.
- **Visual Appeal**: The interface uses card-based layouts and icons for faculties to be visually engaging.
- **Simple Contribution**: Uploading notes should be straightforward for logged-in users.
- **Trust**: The "Approved" status ensures users are downloading verified content.

## User Roles
- **Guest**: Can browse faculties, departments, courses, and view/download approved notes.
- **Student (Logged in)**: Can upload notes and view their own uploaded notes (including pending ones).
- **Admin**: Reviews pending notes and approves or rejects them.
