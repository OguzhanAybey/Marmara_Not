# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is in an active development state. The core structure (Faculties, Departments, Courses, Notes) is implemented. The immediate focus is on establishing documentation (Memory Bank) to facilitate further development.

## Recent Changes
-   **Memory Bank Creation**: Initialized the `memory-bank` directory and core documentation files.
-   **Codebase Analysis**: Reviewed `models.py`, `views.py`, `urls.py`, and `settings.py` to understand the current state.

## Active Decisions
-   **Documentation First**: Prioritizing the creation of the Memory Bank to ensure future AI interactions have full context.

## Next Steps
-   Complete the Memory Bank creation (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
-   Verify the completeness of the documentation against the codebase.
-   (Potential) Review frontend templates to confirm UI library usage (Bootstrap etc.).
